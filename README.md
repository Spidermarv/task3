#  Non-Transitive Dice Game (Task 3)

This is a **command-line implementation** of a generalized **non-transitive dice game** developed in **JavaScript (Node.js)**. The game allows 3 or more custom dice to be passed as command-line arguments, simulates a fair and provably random gameplay session between the user and computer, and showcases non-transitive mechanics often seen in game theory.

-  **Command-line argument parsing** (3 or more custom dice supported)
-  **Provably fair random roll** for both user and computer
-  **User CLI menu interface** (pick dice, help, exit)

##  What are Non-Transitive Dice?

Non-transitive dice are sets of dice for which the relation "is more likely to roll a higher number than" is non-transitive. For example, Dice A might beat Dice B, Dice B beats Dice C, but Dice C beats Dice A â€” similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors.
